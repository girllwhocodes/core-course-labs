# Terraform Best Practices 
1. Directory Structure: Describes the recommended directory structure for my Terraform project. I've organized my code, variables, and modules in a clear and consistent manner.
2. Using built-in formatting. Terraform files conform to the standards of terraform fmt.
3. Reviewing and plan:

# Docker

## terraform state show

  This command shows the attributes of a single resource in the Terraform
  state. The address argument must be used to specify a single resource.
  You can view the list of available resources with "terraform state list".

Options:

  -state=statefile    Path to a Terraform state file to use to look
                      up Terraform-managed resources. By default it will
                      use the state "terraform.tfstate" if it exists.


## terraform state list
docker_container.nginx
docker_image.nginx


## terraform output
docker_container_name = "my-docker_container"

## terraform apply 

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the
following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
```
